# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze students' standardized test scores (math and reading) to get insights into students' performance patterns at different schools. This helps in making strategic decisions at the school and district levels. 

## Analysis Results
In the student dataset, the total dataset size is 19,514 rows. The data was cleaned by removing the null values first, which were 2,847 records, and then by removing duplicated inputs, which were 1,836. The analysis of the clean dataset showed the following observations:
1. The public schools receive a higher average budget than charter schools by about 4.4% ($91k for public and $87k for charter).

2. Comparing the number of students attending different schools showed that Montgomery High School has the highest student count of 2038, and the lowest number of students attending a school was 171 for Chang High School.

3. Charter schools have a higher average math score than the public in different grades. The highest differences between charter and public schools in the average math score were observed for both 9th and 11th grade, with a higher score of 10% and 14.7%, respectively. 

## Summary
Even though public schools receive more budget than charter schools, their performance is not as good as the charter schools. Therefore, further drill-down analysis is needed to understand the reasons for lower scores in math and reading. Accordingly, it helps strategically plan whether more resources are needed to raise their performance to the charter schools' level.
